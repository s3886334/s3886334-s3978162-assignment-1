## Analysis of the Problem
We are trying to set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to ensure code quality, reliability, and deployability.
The goal is to automate the process of testing, code analysis, and artifact generation.

## Explain and Justify the Solution

The solution involves setting up a CI pipeline that includes static code analysis, unit testing, code coverage checks, and artifact generation.
This ensures that any code changes are automatically tested and validated before being merged into the main branch.

## Writing Quality, Layout, and Accuracy

The documentation is structured to provide clear and concise instructions for setting up and running the CI pipeline.
Each section is labeled and explained in detail to ensure accuracy and readability.
