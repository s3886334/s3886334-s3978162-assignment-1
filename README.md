## Expected Output

Static Code Analysis / Lint: The linter will check the code for any stylistic or programming errors.

Unit Testing: All unit tests will be executed, and the results will be displayed.

Code Coverage: A report will be generated showing the percentage of code covered by tests.

Artifact Generation: A deployable artifact will be created if all tests pass.
